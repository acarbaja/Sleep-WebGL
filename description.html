            <h2>Intentions</h2>
            <p class="lead">College students like to sleep, and lo and behold, I am a college student. I also wanted an excuse to use a photo of Joe Johnson and Karina Manta, my favorite figure skaters.
              They are all I really know about figure skating, but they're just enough.</p>
            <p class="lead">My scene depicts someone dozing off, as the early morning sun comes over the horizon. They left their window open, and there are leaves coming in through the window. I was inspired by the artist Heikala.</p>

            <h2>Versions</h2>
            <p class="lead">There were several stages to making the final product:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Sleeping in bed</b>
                  <img src="imgs/originalSleeper.png" width="590"></img>
                  <p class="m-0">In this model, I only made the person's head and hand, because the rest of their body was going to be obscured by the sheets.
                    However, that proved difficult enough! In order to make their hair more realistic, I had to make several different pieces that would all go together.
                    I also had to take a moment to get all of the eyelashes placed so they would align with the larger curvature that makes up the main part of the lash.
                    I chanelled some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Crossing#/media/File:Villager_(character).png" >Animal Crossing villager</a> energy and gave my human a red cone nose.</p>
              </li>
              <p></p>
              <li>
                <b>Leaf Box extravaganza</b>
                <img src="imgs/leaves.png" width="590"></img>
                <p class="m-0" >In order to get the leaves in the right place in my scene, I decided to start a side project.
                  These leaves are generated so they are either inside or on the designated x,y,z boundaries. This would make it easier
                  to make a seemingly more complicated alpha scene (haha)! I did not model any of the leaves themselves. Instead, I made a transparent
                   Bezier surface and mapped a transparent leaf-cutout texture on top. I wasn't sure it was going to work at first, but it turned out pretty cool!</p>
              </li>
              <p></p>
              <li>
                <b>More scene additions</b>
                <img src="imgs/animatedSleeper.png" width="590"> </img>
                <p class="m-0" >I wanted my human to be surrounded by stars, to represent that they had not yet departed from the dream world. In order to make this happen,
                I made a sphere and then mapped a repeating star texture onto it to get a space effect. I also added a wall and a picture of a window. For some finishing touches, I added the aforementioned
                poster of Joe Johnson and Karina Mantas in addition to one of Marina and the Diamonds. (I thought some text would also be fun, so that came in as well). The decorated wall
                represents the wall that would in theory exist in the human's actual room.</p>
              </li>
              <p></p>
              <li>
                <b>Alpha Version Preview</b>
                <video width="590" height="350" src="imgs/sleepVideoDemo.mov" controls="controls"></video>
                <p class="m-0" >Finally, here's a preview of my alpha version! Woohoo! I decided to animate the camera so it would travel in an oval around the scene, but stay
                  focused on our human's face. I also decided that I wanted the stars to move, so I did that by rotating the sphere a little bit every single time
                   I called an animation frame. I also changed some of the Basic materials to Lambert materials for the human to make them look cooler.</p>
